# In Class activity 4.2: Mario Kart Game


### Introduction: 

Create a simple Java program for a Mario Kart game. The game involves players with specific characters, each having a starting speed. Players can boost, which increases their speed.

### Part 1: MarioKartPlayer Class
Define a Java class called MarioKartPlayer with the following attributes:

`playerName (String)`: The name of the player.
`character (String)`: The character chosen for the game (e.g., Mario, Luigi).
`speed (int)`: The current speed of the player.

Include the following methods:

- A constructor to initialize the player with a name, character, and starting speed.
- A boost method that simulates boosting, increasing the player's speed.
- A displayInfo method to display the player's information (name, character, speed).

### Part 2: MarioKartGame Class
Create a Java class called MarioKartGame with the following:

In the main method:

- Instantiate two MarioKartPlayer objects with different names, characters, and starting speeds.
- Display the information of both players.
- Simulate a boost action for each player.
- Display the updated information of both players after the boost.

### Instructions:
Write the code for the MarioKartPlayer and MarioKartGame classes.

Demonstrate the functionality by creating instances of players, displaying their information, boosting, and displaying the updated information.
